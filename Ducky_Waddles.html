<p>Review of the store from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://community.iexplore.com/planning/journalEntryActivity.asp?JournalID=10663&amp;EntryID=18969&amp;n=Ducky+Waddles+Emporium">IExplore</a>:
</p><p><br />
Yes, Virginia, there's a Ducky Waddles. Incredible hodgepodge of books and of art that is "Waay Out" to this viewer. My eyeballs haven't recovered yet. Located right near Lou's Records (in fact, you can see the Ducky Waddles sign in the third of the photos posted in the Lou's entry), this business used to be located south of Encinitas Boulevard in downtown coastal Encinitas. Its more congenial home is this location for its Leucadia all the way.
You won't find any bestsellers in the books section, either old or new, but you will find some interesting classifications- "religion with a small r," "gay and lesbian fact &amp; non-fiction," "tattoo &amp; body modification," "erotic art," "Tolkienana," and "vampirism" are some of the classifications that riveted my eyes. 
</p><p>But, I hadn't seen anything yet. Their gallery is bizarre to me: the current featured artist is the "Haute Art" of Walter Wojtyla, a show that runs through the month of June. My prejudice against much of modern art must be admitted; even in the Tate Modern I saw piles of things in corners that I will never consider art-to me they look like experimental exercises in what the art world will on a whim gush over for its daring audacity. Mr. Wojtyla, according to the posted signs, is an "established artist," and some of the price tags accompanying his art seemed to reflect that status, but I couldn't live with any of the garish work I saw.
</p><p>As an alternative eye-opener, a short visit to this emporium is illuminating. Signs for coming one man shows did display mostly what I would consider extraterrestrially eccentric, but,I guess there's tribute here to the hoary saying, "In taste, there's no disputing." 
</p><p>My reaction to the very modern art this gallery displays is not totally negative, however. The silkscreens of Marco Almera, for example, caught my eye, as well as a work entitled "Silver Surfer," by an artist called Mobius, which was on the store's web site. Their e-mail newsletter is fittingly dubbed "Quack of the Duck." If you want to be adventurous, or really have an affinity for modern art, or are searching for comic art, this unique store might aid you in your search for the avant garde. The telephone number is 760-632-0488, useful as opening hours seem a bit erratic.
