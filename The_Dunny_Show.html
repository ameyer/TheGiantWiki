<p>From <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://kidrobot.com/">Kidrobot.com</a>:
</p><p>NEW YORK CITY, March 29, 2004 – Kidrobot, a leading designer and retailer of limited-edition vinyl action figures, today announced that it will feature the work of more than 50 important artists and designers with backgrounds in fine art, graffiti, industrial design, and illustration, in a unique exhibition of customized Dunny toys that will be held at the Visionaire Gallery from May 17 – July 17, 2004.  
</p><p>Dunny, which is a 20-inch tall action figure made of soft, smooth vinyl, was conceived and designed by Kidrobot toy designer Tristan Eaton and owner/President Paul Budnitz to be a “toy with attitude” that could be customized in a broad variety of styles by diverse artists working in different mediums.
</p><p>Among the artists and designers who will personalize a Dunny for the exhibition are world-famous graffiti artists Doze Green, Fafi, and Seen; renowned toy designers Jason Siu and Pete Fowler; illustrators including Disney’s Teacher’s Pet creator Gary Baseman; graphic artists including HunterGatherer; fashion designers Diane von Furstenberg and Kenzo Minami; and a number of fine artists, including Alexis Rockman.  Design studio participants include artists from PDI/Dreamworks Animation Studios and Steuben Crystal.
</p><p>Paul Budnitz, the owner and President of Kidrobot, said, “Dunny’s curved body and large, blank features offer the artist who paints him a unique canvas on which to fashion a distinct personality.  We are thrilled that the opportunity to participate in The Dunny Show has generated such an enthusiastic response from so many talented artists and designers and we look forward to displaying their work to the public in the intimate setting of the Visionaire Gallery.”
</p><p>Cecilia Dean, one of the founders of Visionaire Publishing and the Visionaire Gallery, said, “For us, it is exciting to enter into the world of toys and to feature new artists in the gallery.  Kidrobot is  our equivalent in the toy industry and this marks the beginning of an on-going collaboration between Visionaire and Kidrobot.” 
</p><p>All of the Dunny toys created for this exhibition will be available for purchase at the Visionaire Gallery.  A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Hetrick-Martin Institute to help fund a variety of educational and after-school programs.
