															<!-- start content -->
					<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Ok. So you've braved the crowds and the server slow-downs and the nerve-wracking browser re-direct to and from PayPal in order to purchase a Shepard Fairey/Obey Giant print. 
</p><p>Congratulations! Happy-Happy, Joy-Joy! 
</p><p>Then, POW! UPS decides they want to ship your precious, precious tube stored next to a three hundred pound gorilla that decides to use it as a toothpick… then a baseball bat… and then a skateboard.  The beautiful, limited edition print you slaved for minutes and seconds to win arrives on your doorstep dented, crushed, spindled AND mutilated. What do you do now (apart, that is, from dabbing the tears from your eyes, clenching your fists and screaming obscenities at the injustice of it all)? 
</p><p>Well, good news: filing a claim with UPS and receiving a new print is incredibly easy. 
</p><p><br />
<b>FIRST: Call UPS at 1-800-PICK-UPS (1-800-742-5877).</b> You’ll hit their automated voice system and it will ask you what you want to do. Say aloud, “damage claim,” or “crushed tube,” or “your incompetent, over-rated delivery service has resulted in the snuffing out of what little faith I had left in humanity” and your call will automatically be directed to the appropriate person. 
</p><p>Explain your problem to the nice person on the other end of the phone line. They’ll ask for the UPS tracking number (found on the white sheet of paper affixed to your tube) and the print’s approximate value. You’ll then be asked to leave the tube (with the print inside it – no, you don’t get to keep it) out for a UPS driver to pick up the next day from the address it was delivered to (i.e., leave it next to your front door). UPS will contact Obey Giant and then pick up your print. 
</p><p><b>NEXT: Send an email to orders@obeygiant.com explaining what happened (crushed tube, damaged print) and what you’ve done about it (called UPS, filed a claim).</b> This information, combined with the receipt of the claim from UPS will result in Obey Giant sending a replacement print to your address, lickity-split. 
</p><p><br />
That’s it. That’s all you have to do. A three minute phone call to UPS and sixty-seconds spent composing an email to Obey Giant is the sum total of the time it takes to set everything right with the world. You are now free to celebrate in an appropriate manner. 
</p><p><i>Please note that if the print you’ve received is damaged but there is no noticeable damage to the tube itself, contact orders@obeygiant.com FIRST as the process is a little different and could require you taking photos of the damage, emailing them in, and then waiting on the receipt of a new shipping label from Obey Giant before shipping it back to them.</i> 
</p><p><br />
Good luck and Godspeed John Glenn.
