<p>In 2001, Shepard Fairey produced a promotional poster for the <i>How I Spent my Summer Vacation</i> record release parties. This poster was based on the graphic used in <a href="./Ministry_of_Information.html" title="Ministry of Information">Ministry of Information</a>.  Later, in 2003, Shepard Fairey issued a promotional poster for The Bouncing Souls' album <i>Anchors Aweigh</i>.  The graphic used is a variation of <a href="./Lesser_Gods_Eagle.html" title="Lesser Gods Eagle">Lesser Gods Eagle</a>.  It has been reported that this poster was neither signed nor numbered.

<p>From <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://music.yahoo.com/ar-284936-bio--The-Bouncing-Souls">Yahoo Music</a>:
</p><p>The Bouncing Souls started out in 1987 with the intention of playing loud fast three-chord party music around their native New Jersey; besides, it gave them something to do while they were in high school. Upon graduation and after years of struggling to find a label to release their records, friends Greg Attonito (vocals), Pete Steinkopf (guitar), Bryan Kienlen (bass), and Shal Khichi (drums) got some money together and -- in true D.I.Y. fashion -- formed Chunksaah Records in 1993. Upon the formation of their own label, two EPs were to follow, entitled <i>Argyle</i> and <i>Neurotic</i>, before they released their first full-length, <i>The Good, the Bad &amp; the Argyle</i>, in 1994.
</p><p>Considerable touring and partying were to follow before the band struck a deal with BYO Records in 1995. Not only did they re-release their debut album along with their follow-up, <i>Maniacal Laughter</i>, but they were also starting to make a name for themselves by opening for NOFX, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, 7 Seconds, and the Descendents, among other big names. Their style of singalong, hard-hitting, and passionate pop-punk caught the ears of Epitaph Records in 1997. In that same year, their self-titled third album was released, which not only called attention to the Bouncing Souls around the world, but also enabled them to leave their full-time jobs for a while. The live EP <i>Tie One On</i> held fans over in 1998 before their fourth album, <i>Hopeless Romantic</i>, was released in 1999. 
</p><p>Khichi left the band in 2000, and Michael McDermott replaced him soon after on drums. <i>How I Spent My Summer Vacation</i> appeared in spring 2001. Two years later, the band assembled its most honest material to date for the release of <i>Anchors Aweigh</i>. That same year, the band also put together and released the double-disc <i>Do You Remember? 15 Years of the Bouncing Souls</i>, which comprehensively documented the guys from their humble D.I.Y. roots through to the early 2000s. Another DVD, a live one, came out in September 2005 on Kung Fu, and a live two-disc album followed two months later on Chunksaah. The Bouncing Souls' next proper studio effort, <i>The Gold Record</i>, appeared in June 2006; in celebration, the Souls played a string of six soldout shows at N.Y.C.'s The Knitting Factory leading up to its release. The band then spent the entire summer on Warped's main stage. ~ Mike DaRonco, All Music Guide
