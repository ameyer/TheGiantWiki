<b>5280 Gets Shepard Fairey to Design DNC Obama Cover</b>
</p><p><i>Regional Denver magazine scores street artist coup. BY DYLAN STABLEFORD</i>
</p><p><br />
</p><p><a href="File:5280_obama_shepard_fairey.jpg.html" class="image"><img alt="5280 obama shepard fairey.jpg" src="images/7/73/5280_obama_shepard_fairey.jpg" width="216" height="283" /></a>
</p><p><br />
Denver, Colorado is gearing up for the Democratic Convention later this month, and <i>5280</i>, the city’s well-regarded regional magazine, scored a bit of coup by landing Shepard Fairey, the renowned street artist, to design its August cover.
</p><p>“I honestly think it's the best issue we've ever done,” Daniel Brogan, <i>5280</i>’s editor and publisher, wrote in an e-mail to <i>FOLIO</i>:.
</p><p>Fairey, who gained notoriety in the late 1990s for his viral “Obey” designs, featuring an iconic image of Andre the Giant, received similar critical acclaim for a Barack Obama poster he designed earlier this year.
</p><p>“Anytime you put a politician on the cover of a magazine, you're bound to make people mad. And in a swing state like Colorado, a political cover means you're probably going to offend a whole bunch of people,” Brogan wrote in his editor’s note. “So when we sat down to choose an image that would kick off this month's issue of <i>5280</i>, we spent weeks looking for a way to avoid anything that might be construed as partisan.”
</p><p>But when they settled on an Obama cover, Brogan fired off a blind e-mail to Fairey. “His people got back to me within a few hours,” Brogan wrote. “He was very open to our ideas and didn't complain a bit about the usual concessions you have to make for things like logos, headlines, and UPC codes.”
</p><p>While Brogan declined to reveal what he paid Fairey for the cover design, he hinted <i>5280</i>’s wide distribution in Denver led the artist to give the magazine a discounted rate. The magazine has a circulation of 92,000.
</p><p>“Let's just say that Shepard was very accommodating,” Brogan wrote. “He really understood both the importance of the occasion, and the fact that it'll be seen by a lot of key people.” In addition to its newsstand presence, <i>5280</i> is placed nearly all of the area's top hotels, so the delegates, media and VIPs attending the convention will see Fairey’s image, Brogan wrote.
</p><p>“People seem pretty surprised that Shepard would do a cover for a local magazine, so it's been a real coup for us.”
</p><p>Annual revenue for <i>5280</i> is approximately $8 million, up from $5 million in 2004.
