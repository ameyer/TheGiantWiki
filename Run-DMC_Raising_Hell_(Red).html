<p>From <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://obeygiant.com/run-dmc-raising-hell-gold-and-red-available-march-3rd/">Obey Giant</a>:<br />This “RUN-DMC Raising Hell” print is a collaboration with Glen E. Friedman and celebrates the release of his latest incredible book, “Together Forever!” The book showcases all of his amazing photos of RUN-DMC and Beastie Boys from before they were well known, through their time as collaborators/tour mates and well beyond. Glen made the photos that appeared on the Beastie Boys “Check Your Head” cover as well as Run-DMC’s “Walk This Way” among many others. As creative pioneers, both groups expanded the cultural influence and reach of hip hop. I especially like that “Together Forever” explains how the two groups were friends and worked closely together, as it promotes racial unity. In the current climate of divisiveness, it’s a great reminder that there does not need to be a racial divide. 
</p><p><br />
I have always loved Glen’s original iconic photograph of RUN-DMC made in their own neighborhood of Hollis, Queens, NY, that I primarily based this illustration on. An oversized print of the photo has been displayed in the entry of my Studio Number One offices for many years. I also used this image as a reference for my “Jam Master Jay” tribute portrait when he passed away in 2002 (one of the first collaborations Glen and I worked on together). However, for this collaboration, Glen suggested I also look at an alternate photo from the same session where Run (Joseph Simmons) was holding up his fist and had a slightly different facial expression. I referenced both photos to create this new illustration and added in a lot of RUN-DMC vintage ephemera Glen had collected to the collage, including other well know photos of his. Run a.k.a. Rev Run (Joseph Simmons) and DMC (Darryl McDaniels) both loved how the piece came out, enough to sign it along with me and Glen. I’ve been a RUN-DMC fan since I was a teen, and they are the group, along with Beastie Boys, who turned me on to hip hop, so this collaboration is a huge honor. Be sure to pick up a copy of “Together Forever” if, like me, you are a big fan of both groups. I also collaborated with Glen on “Together Forever” apparel through Obey Clothing which features this RUN-DMC art as well as a Beastie Boys illustration. You can check those out on obeyclothing.com and at select retailers.
