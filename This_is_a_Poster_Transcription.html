This writing is the DESIGN upon the POSTER. The DESIGN is used to help SELL the POSTER. We hope to draw your attetion <i>[sic]</i> to it and encourage you to look at it. When you have done that maybe you’ll be persuaded to buy the POSTER, in this case an OBEY POSTER. Then we want you to hang it. The idea being that the more of you that hang this, the more other people will see it, and the more others will be indoctrinated by our propaganda, adding steam to the already vicious momentum of the OBEY juggernaut toward ultimate world domination. This can be a symbiotic relationship with OBEY because hanging a clever, or at least “conceptual” POSTER design can make one feel superior, a feeling which can also lead to PLEASURE. A good POSTER DESIGN will attract more buyers and give more pleasure. Therefore, buying a POSTER creates pleasure. When feeling depressed, do not forget this. OBEY is most known for creating eye-catching picture. It is designed to get you to READ IT. This is called luring the VICTIM, and you are the VICTIM. But VICTIM of what? You have an inquisitive nature and discriminating intellect, so you want information but you will not be manipulated by subversive sales tactics. But you are a mover and shaker who’s <i>[sic]</i> time should not be wasted on gimmicks, so you should STOP READING NOW! Because all we are attempting to do is to get you to read on. Yet this is a DOUBLE BIND because if you indeed stop you’ll be doing what we tell you, and if you read on you’ll be doing what we wanted all along. And the more you read on, the more you’re falling for this simple design device of telling you exactly how a good commercial design works. But, you have a free mind so you can decide for yourself. Exercise your free will. Psychological ploys… they’re TRICKS and this is the worst TRICK of all since it’s describing the TRICK whilst trying to TRICK you, and if you’ve read this far then you’re TRICKED but you wouldn’t have known this unless you’ve read this far. At least we’re telling you directly instead of seducing you with a beautiful or haunting visual that may never tell you. We’re letting you know that you ought to buy this POSTER because in essence it’s a PRODUCT and PRODUCTS are to be consumed and you are a consumer and this is a good PRODUCT. And good products make you superior, and superiority brings you pleasure. We could have written the company’s name in special lettering so that it stood out and you’d see it before you’d read any of this writing and possibly have bought it anyway. What we are really suggesting is that you are FOOLISH to buy or not buy a POSTER merely for the pretty picture. This is a con because if you agree then you’ll probably like this writing – which is the POSTER design. Reflexivity ought not to be so ironic and paradoxical, but life is not always simple. Things are not always what they seem, or sometimes they are even more of what they seem, or land somewhere in between, or both, or neither. But… we’re just warning you of all that. A con is a con. A good POSTER design could be considered as one that gets you to buy the POSTER, but that never actually happens to YOU because YOU know it’s just a design for the POSTER, and a con. And this is the POSTER. A POSTER that is evidence of an awareness of, or a susceptibility to, CONSPICUOUS COSUMPTION <i>[sic]</i>. A product of OBEY… repeat.
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="In_Response_to_Typos">In Response to Typos</span></h2>
<p>"So, I have been made aware of a couple of typos in <a href="This_is_a_Poster.html" title="This is a Poster">This is a Poster</a>. I've read the copy at least 10 times and didn't notice the errors. Too bad it is already printed. Yeah, serves me right for making a poster with smug copy. Instant karma will get you. There will be no recall of the poster as I think it still works typos 'n' all. Oh, I might also mention that the poster was inspired by XTC's "GO TO" album cover."<br />
