Yeah, Boyeee! Spin Turns 20!
</p><p>By: Peter Gaston
</p><p>September 29, 2005
</p><p><br />
<a href="Public_Enemy.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a> turned back (Flavor Flav's) clock as Spin celebrated its 20th anniversary with a wild bash at New York's Webster Hall.
</p><p><br /> 
Just a few minutes before <a href="Public_Enemy.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a> took the stage at Spin's 20th anniversary bash at New York's Webster Hall last night, Darryl McDaniels -- the rapper known best as DMC -- told the crowd about his first encounter with <a href="Public_Enemy.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a>. "The first time I heard Public Enemy, it was on college radio," the hip hop legend said. "And when I heard Chuck D, it was as if God himself had come down from heaven and picked up a microphone." Truer words were not uttered onstage all night. <a href="Public_Enemy.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a>'s marathon set opened a seam in time back to 1988, the year It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back dropped from the skies and turned hip hop from a curious underground phenomenon into a cultural revolution.
</p><p><a href="Public_Enemy.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a> provided the delicious last drops of bubbly on a splendid evening that traversed Spin's two decades of existence. Current indie heroes Death Cab for Cutie, who, like just about every other performer, seemed completely awestruck to be opening for Public Enemy, provided the emotive touch, unveiling live versions of the pristine, detailed songs from their latest record, Plans. Fittingly, the band -- backed by a twinkling starscape -- opened with "Marching Bands of Manhattan," their lilting portrait of Spin's fair hometown. Set highlights included other gems from Plans like "Soul Meets Body," "Summer Skin," and the innately catchy "Crooked Teeth," plus older faves "Company Calls," "The New Year," and "Lightness," among others.
</p><p>LCD Soundsystem, Drive-By Truckers, and Lady Sovereign got the party started earlier on the main stage, with the one-two punch of LCD and Sov considerably upping the rhythmic ante, particularly James Murphy's dependably effusive performance on LCD burners like "Tribulations" and "Yeah."
</p><p>Downstairs in the Op Lounge, upstarts Nightmare of You packed the room with an early set that kicked off with "My Name Is Trouble," the lithe apex of their debut album. In a live setting, the recent SPIN.com Band of the Day underpinned their somewhat mopey, Smiths-ish songs with a vigorous rhythmic vitality that made them a crowd favorite; people were either raving about their set, or bummed they'd missed it. Later, the Living Things pummeled ear drums with their blistering brand of rock, helping shake into action all the nerve endings that Death Cab had massaged into relaxed bliss. In between, Norwegian weirdos Hurra Torpedo apparently played stoves, refrigerators, and other household appliances; SPIN.com was upstairs interviewing Death Cab, but we heard Hurra's set would make Emeril proud.
</p><p>But <a href="Public_Enemy.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a> stole the show, and the rest of the bands seemed perfectly okay with that being the case. Casual fans left remembering Flavor Flav's minute-long rendition of his two-word catchphrase, "Yeah boyeeeeeee." Those closer to the stage will also remember that his signature wall clock necklace was an official Flavor Flav clock, complete with a miniature plastic version of Flav attached. Those really listening to Chuck D's words noticed him performing a freshly minted song, dropping lyrics off printed computer pages that attacked the government's response to poor black Americans in the Gulf Coast. He even reiterated Kanye West's now-famous line, "George Bush doesn't care about black people"; Flav jumped in: "Did you see Mike Myers face?"
</p><p>We hope Flav and Chuck saw all of our faces, awestruck and blown over by the presence of true innovators on a night celebrating just that: all the music that rocks.
