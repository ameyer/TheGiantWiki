<p>Queens of the Stoneage came to bury NuMetal, not to praise it. While the current crop of black shirted crybabies strap on their 7-string guitars and warmed over hip/hop, frontmen Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri have opted to turn the QUEENS into an unpredictable, ever-changing unit, a kind of Q-Tang Clan of Rock.
</p><p>Emerging from the California desert in 1998 their debut (<i>QOTSA</i> - Loosegroove Records) picked up where the ruins of Kyuss left off, incorporating more pop and soul elements into a psychedelic, trance-inducing genre that came to be known as "Stoner Rock." Their next release (<i>Rated R</i> - Interscope) further plumbed the depths of this amorphous style and created a mind expanding soundtrack that left critics and audiences wowed on both sides of the Atlantic.
</p><p>Homme and Oliveri took the act on the road and left a trail of dazed converts wherever they went on the two-year tour blitz that followed. Performing with acts all across the musical landscape (Foo Fighters, Ween, Smashing Pumpkins, Pantera, Ozzy), the Queens quickly built a reputation as an uncategorizable and highly original act in a sea of drum-programmed sheep. Homme also launched a label (Rekords Rekords) to showcase his <i>Desert Sessions</i> series and various gems from the vault. 
</p><p>Armed with a wealth of new material (and producer Eric Valentine), the Queens are now completing their new record (<i>Songs for the Deaf</i> - Interscope), and once again they’ve confounded expectations with an audacious, challenging release. In addition to Oliveri (bass/vox) and Homme (gtr/vox), rock legends Dave Grohl (drums) and Mark Lanegan (vox) grace the new LP. Adding further depth to the sonic arsenal are live stalwarts Brendon McNichol, Gene Trautman, and "Diamond" Dave Catching, all long-time collaborators and original players in their own right.
</p><p>What’s next for the unrepentant Kings of Stoner Rock? According to Oliveri-
</p><p>"The Queens of the Stongeage are gonna keep putting out new music and touring the world. Get up on it or get left behind!"

<p>On January 27th, 2005, the rock poster collective PNE, or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.postneoexplosionism.com/">Post Neo Explosionism</a>, issued a statement announcing their new project:
</p><p>After a nearly 2 year hiatus, PNE has re-grouped for several new projects. For those of you who may not know, PNE stands for "POST NEO EXPLOSIONISM"... which is a periodic artistic collaboration between 3 established poster artists: Justin Hampton, Jermaine Rogers, and EMEK. 
</p><p>For now, we'll discuss the first project: many of you remember the QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE series from nearly 2 years ago. PNE was commisioned to create a series of concert posters for the band's 2003 North American tour. Between the 3 members of PNE, a seperate limited-edition poster was created for each and every one of the 26 shows.
</p><p>Well, QOTSA has hired us again. We will be creating official concert posters for their upcoming North American tour, slated to begin in Austin on March 15th, 2005. These posters will be used in official promotion before the show and in merch sales at the show. In order to throw a new wrinkle in the project this time around, we talked to the Queens about doing something a bit different. The upcoming QOTSA album is full of "guest talent" (you all will LOVE it). The 3 of us thought about it, and felt that the series should reflect that same spirit. So, we sought out a group of artists that we felt would provide a dynamic infusion of hardcore talent and creativity and they have been given various posters throughout the run. 
</p><p>We let QOTSA know what we wanted to do, and they are behind us 100%.
</p><p>In this way, we think we will get a pretty amazing series in the end...plus, the series will show a variety of talent from different areas of the poster world. Hopefully this will shine yet another light on our "poster community"... and maybe prove to be another teeny-tiny step in getting the poster community...all of us... the attention, oppurtunities, and  we all deserve.
</p><p>We've chosen 7 guest artists.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="./Shepard_Fairey.html" title="Shepard Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a> was one of the seven guest artists chosen by PNE to produce a Queens of the Stone Age show poster.  <a href="./Shepard_Fairey.html" title="Shepard Fairey">Shepard's</a> poster, <a href="./Queens_of_the_Stone_Age.html" title="Queens of the Stone Age">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, was produced for the March 20, 2005 show at the Nova in Norfolk, Virginia in a limited edition of 250 copies.  
</p><p>A series of 200 offset postcard sheets, of which 40 were signed by PNE artists Justin Hampton, EMEK, Jermaine Rogers, and Tara McPherson, were released.  The postcard sheet shows the entire run of 2005 Queens of the Stoneage tour posters, including <a href="./Shepard_Fairey.html" title="Shepard Fairey">Shepard's</a>.  The postcards were also available in cut form.
