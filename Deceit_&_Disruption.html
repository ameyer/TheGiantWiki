<p>From <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://obeygiant.com/prints/deceit-disruption/">Obey Giant</a>:<br /> Francisco Reyes Jr. and I have been working together for several years now, and we frequently talk about politics and social issues. When Cisco presented the concept of the Disruption and Disorder series as a possible collaboration, I immediately loved the power of the symbols used to call out the villains and their tactics. As America has moved toward a corporatocracy, the tactics of politicians like Trump and many corporations to brazenly undermine fact, science, and reasonable debate by spreading chaos and disinformation to advance their own agendas over the well-being of the public has become even more pervasive. When greed, disinformation, and indifference become the status quo, it is time to dissent. I really enjoy illustrating skulls and fire, so this art as a small act of dissent was a bit of visceral therapy. Cisco and I are both intensely frustrated with the state of politics, and I’m glad we were able to collaborate and bond with a bit of artistic resistance! – Shepard
</p><p><br />
The Disruption and Disorder series was inspired by the divisive rhetoric and dog whistles President Trump uses to manipulate the media. As a first generation Mexican-American, the hate spewed from then-candidate Trump was appalling on a deeply personal level. I thought that surely such a hateful man would never win the election. How wrong I was! On November 8th, I watched the nightmare unfold in complete shock and disappointment.  In the past, my work has displayed political undertones, but never as blatant as in this collaboration. I felt compelled to address my discontent and grievances with President Trump, so I ran the concept of a collaboration by Shepard and he was down.
</p><p>Given his history of overtly political art and sticking it to The Man, I knew Shepard would be familiar with where I was coming from. I was 16 years old when President George W. Bush was elected—this was also the time I began to really pay attention to the political climate of this country. 9/11 further solidified my interest, and it was around this time that I discovered Shep’s work. His criticism and satire of the Bush administration paired with the aesthetic and message of his work was (and continues to be) inspiring. 
</p><p>Fast forward 16 years—I have now been working under Shep for the past 5 ½ years and in this time, he has nurtured and facilitated my growth as an artist. The discipline and techniques I acquired through his guidance have now come full circle and manifested in this collaboration—it is a direct criticism of Trump’s America. I hope the message will resonate with others just as it did for me so long ago. – Francisco
